REQUIREMENTS

Data structure is a way of organizing data in the computer so that it can be used effectively. The data structures used in this project are:
•	Array
•	Vectors
•	Unordered Map
•	HashMap
•	Linked List
•	Heap
•	Stack
•	Graph



•	The array data structure is implemented using ArrayList class which is a resizable array.It stores data in contiguous memory locations.
•	Hashmap data structure is used to store key-value pairs.
•	The stack data structure required by the algorithm is implemented using linked list.It follows the principle Last In First Out(LIFO)
•	Heap is implemented with the help of ArrayList and HashMap.It is a tree based data structure where all elements of the tree are in a particular order.
•	Graph is a complex data structure containing vertices and edges connecting these vertices.This is implemented in the project with the help of ArrayList and HashMap.
•	Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path.

•		Utilize breadth-first search or depth-first search for alternative route- finding approaches.
